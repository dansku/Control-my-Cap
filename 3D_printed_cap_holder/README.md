CONTROL MY CAP: 3D-Printed Cap Holder
=====================================
These are the 3D printed parts for holding the LED Board on my cap, along with the light diffuser. This design has been printed and tested successfully on a MakerBot Replicator Dual, using PLA.
  
Unfortunately, I cannot release the design files or firmware for the PCB at this time. It is about 110mm diameter.
