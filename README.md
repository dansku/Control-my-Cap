CONTROL MY CAP
==============
This Repo is still a work in progress!  Completion expected by May 25th, 2013.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the open design files for my "Control My Cap" project, which will enable crowd control of a high-intensity LED array mounted on my mortar board for my graduation from the Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering Program at Cornell University.
  
Note:  I am opening as many files as I can.  Part of my design utilizes firmware and electronics from a another project of mine that I cannot (yet) open source.  You can sign up to learn more about it here: http://www.sunnlight.com.
