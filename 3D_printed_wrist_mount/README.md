CONTROL MY CAP: 3D-Printed Wrist Mount
======================================
These are the 3D printed parts for holding the control interface on my wrist. The case holds both a Raspberry Pi and the Adafruit [LCD Pi Plate](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1115). I've added a cutout for the buttons/LCD, as well as a support tray for the SD card to protect it.  There is ventilation for the Pi, and two strap mounting points on the bottom. A wrist clip snaps into these strap mounting points as well, as is included in the wrist_clip folder. A channel allows the micro USB power cable to be routed in the same direction as the USB-serial cable that goes to the hat.  This is designed for the wearer's right wrist. This design has been printed and tested successfully on a MakerBot Replicator Dual, using PLA.
