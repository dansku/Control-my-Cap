CONTROL MY CAP: 3D-Printed Wrist Mount
======================================
These are the 3D printed parts for holding the control interface on my wrist. The case holds both a Raspberry Pi and the Adafruit (LCD Pi Plate)[http://www.adafruit.com/products/1115]. I've added a cutout for the buttons/LCD, as well as a support tray for the SD card to protect it.  There is ventilation for the Pi, and two strap mounting points on the bottom. A channel allows the micro USB power cable to be routed in the same direction as the USB-serial cable that goes to the hat.  This is designed for the wearer's right wrist. This design has been printed and tested successfully on a MakerBot Replicator Dual, using PLA. It is based on this design: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23430
